                I'm an aspiring software developer and graduating senior at Florida Tech.
                My interests include formal methods, website design, emulation, machine learning, and competitive programming.
                Currently, I work as an undergraduate research assistant as part of the A.S.S.I.S.T. lab at Florida Tech.
